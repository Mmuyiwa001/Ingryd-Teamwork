# The 4 seasons

In **Nigeria** the four seasons are
+ Rainy Season
+ Harmattan Season
+ Hot Season 1
+ Dry Season 2

  These equate to the four season in the western world, which are
  1. Summer
  2. Autumn
  3. Winter
  4. Spring
 
My favorite quote is:
> The quick brown fox  
> jumped over the  
> lazy dog
